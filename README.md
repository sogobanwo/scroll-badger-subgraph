## Overview

Welcome to **Badger**, the no-code platform designed to simplify the deployment and interaction with smart contracts on the Scroll blockchain. Our intuitive interface and powerful backend ensure that you can focus on what truly matters - bringing your blockchain ideas to life.

## Features

- **Token Creation**: Users can create FTs and NFTs by interacting with a user-friendly interface.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Fully compatible with any EVM-based blockchain.
- **EIP Standard**: Tokens follows the Ethereum Standard.
- **Interactivity**: Interact with deployed contracts with ease, thanks to our built-in tools.

## Tools

- [**_NextJs_**](https://nextjs.org/)
- [**_Hardhat_**](https://hardhat.org/)
- [**_TypeScript_**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [**_Solidity_**](https://soliditylang.org/)

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Users use their wallet to connect to the platform.
2. **Get Faucet Tokens**: For the sake of the demo you can get the Sepolia-Scroll token from this [faucet](https://chaindrop.org/?chainid=8082&token=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
3. **Token Configuration**: Users select the type of token they wish to create and configure its properties.
4. **Deployment**: The tokens are deployed to the Scroll blockchain.
5. **Management**: Users can manage their tokens within the platform.

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to get a development environment running.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sogobanwo/scroll-badger-contract-
cd badger
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Future plans

As we move on from the hackathon we plan to add more functionalities like:

- The ability for users dynamically select what features their contract should involve e.g if they want their token burnable, ownable, mintable, e.t.c.
- The ability for users to create `staking` contract, `governance` contract and more.
- Badger Sdk for developers to create and build, deploy smart contract on scroll using languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#.

We believe that this tool will be great for onboarding more users to the Scroll network.
